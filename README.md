# Cypress e2e tests training project

## Description
This is my first automated testing project using JS and Cypress framework. I prepared some test scenarios for React Redux app availaible here: [Conduit](https://react-redux.realworld.io/#/). Conduit is very popular sample app for test, so testting it is nothing original. Anyway, my goal is to create complete test project for this website
By this project, I wanted to get essential and some intermediate knowledge about amazing Cypress framework and its capabilities.

## Prerequisites
Complete information about system requirements and Cypress installation you can find here: [docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html#System-requirements](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html#System-requirements).
